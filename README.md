# Entropy-SMP-Mods
The mods for the newest season of  Entropy SMP.

Hi! If you are a member of Entropy SMP, here's how to download these mods:
1. Find the green "Code" button and click on the arrow to open a dropdown box.
2. Press the "Download ZIP" button and let it download.
3. Unzip the download, if you are unable to you may have to use a program like 7zip.
4. In the folder that was just created, find the part of the file with all of the mods, you should see a bunch of .jar files.
5. Pull those files out of the extracted folder and put them in your mods folder.

Here's how you find your mods folder on Windows:
1. Open your search bar and type in "run", you should see an app with the same name.
2. In that app, enter the text "%appdata%", and hit Ok.
3. In the folder that just opened, find the folder called ".minecraft".
4. Inside .minecraft, you should see another folder called "mods".
5. Put any mods you download inside there.

These are not all of the mods, some are server side and thus you do not need to install them, and some are optional client side mods. These include:
* Better Sodium Video Settings
* EntityCulling
* GammaUtils
* LambDynamicLights
* Litematica (and its dependency Mali Lib)
